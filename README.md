Campus Geo Quiz is a mobile application that was made specifically for the
University of Sunderland. Its main purpose was to walk around the St. Peter
campus and find hidden items, once you find the hidden items you will have 
to answer correctly to the quiz to store the item in your inventory. The 
application has 2 different kinds of users, normal users, and admins. Admins
are different from the users as the admins are the ones that can add items
on the map and set up the quizzes for each item.
